# Smart-Contract-Templates

The aim of this repository is to allow Solidity developers the convenience of starting off from a template instead of scratch for commonly used Smart Contracts. This repo will be maintained in such a way that every contract available will be as generalised as possible for the specific use case and the developer should be able to directly edit the functions in the contract to customize it for their use case.
